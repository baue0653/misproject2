                <h3>Why I Chose University of Minnesota Duluth</h3>
                <p class="muted">I chose to attend the University of Minnesota because of the variety of different aspects it had when I was choosing the college I wanted to attend. First off all, I chose it because of the size of the campus. I didn’t want to go to super big school or small school, UMD was the perfect size. Secondly, I chose it because of the city. Duluth is a very unique city that has a lot to do unlike my hometown. Lastly, I chose it because of the major I wanted to go into. I’m majoring in Consumer Insights and Analytics, which is a major not many schools have.</p>

                    <h3>What I Like About Duluth</h3>
                    <p class="muted">There is many things I like about Duluth. One thing is all the hiking and walking trails Duluth has to offer. My favorite places to walk are Chester Park, Lester Park, and the Boardwalk in Canal Park. Another reason I like Duluth is the cool city culture. Duluth has a wide variety of people and its cool seeing all the different events the different groups put on. Lastly and my favorite thing about Duluth is Park Point Beach. I love the beach and ocean, and having something so similar so close to campus is amazing. I love going to the beach in the summer to tan or watch the sunset year round.</p>

                    <h3>Campus Highlights & Experiences</h3>
                    <p class="muted">On campus I have been involved in some different clubs. Some being Women in Business, AMA, Tennis club, and Consumer Insights and Analytics. From being in each club, I have met many great people. Each club does different activities that are fun and engaging that have benefited me educationally and socially. I enjoyed living on campus during my freshman year in the dorms. I found it as a great way to meet new people, and I just made so many memories from living in the dorms.</p>
