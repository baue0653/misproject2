                    <h3>Traveling</h3>
                    <p class="muted">A hobby of mine I have is traveling. I love seeing new places and getting to explore different places and cultures. I always enjoy traveling with my family. I prefer a beach vacation over one in mountains just because I love the beach and ocean. My favorite places I’ve traveled is Washington, London, Ireland, and South Carolina.</p>

                    <h3>Hanging Out with Friends</h3>
                    <p class="muted">A hobby of mine is hanging out with friends. I enjoy spending time with people that bring up my mood and are fun to be around. I like to do various activities with my friends whether it’s staying in and chilling or going out an adventure with them. Some of my favorite things I’ve done with my friends is going to the beach to watch the sunset, going to the lake, attending concerts together, going on walks, or just chilling and talking.</p>

                    <h3>Concerts</h3>
                    <p class="muted">A hobby I enjoy doing is going to concerts for different artists. I love seeing my favorite artists in concert. My favorite concert I’ve been to is Olivia Rodrigo—she is definitely my favorite artist. Other artists I’ve seen in concert are Five Seconds of Summer, The Lumineers, Keith Urban, Eric Church, Chris Young, and Riley Green.</p>

                <h3>Why These Activities Matter</h3>
                <p class="muted">These hobbies that I do are small things that make me the person I am. I enjoy doing them cause they help me stay balanced, creative, and connected within my life and the people in my life. For example, tennis has been an important activity in my life because of what the sport has taught me and the friendships I made from it. It’s been a good hobby within my life because it gives me something to do when I need a break from my everyday life. Concerts are also matter to me because the excitement and preparation before the event is just as exciting as when you get to see your favorite artist in concert. Having a concert to look forward to spikes more excitement within my life. Lastly, hanging out with friends matters to me because being with them just makes me a better person all around. My friends motivate me and help improve my life everyday just by spending time with them. That is why all these activities are important to me.</p>
